Ik ben een creatief persoon en ben graag fysiek bezig.
In mijn B&B zul je de sfeer van creativiteit kunnen proeven.
De inrichting van heel mijn huis heb ik in de stijl van het huis wat in 1924 gebouwd is. Bovendien is het een bewuste keuze om te recycelen.

Naast mijn benb vind ik het heerlijk om in mijn tuin te tuinieren.  Ik schilder graag en maak tassen. 
Ik help anderen hun huis te reorganiseren en opknappen.
Dus u zou mij in kluskleding aan kunnen treffen ;-)

Sinds kort bezit ik een camperbusje. Ik ben daar erg blij mee en ga graag naar natuulijke campings waar het vaak mooi, rustig en vriendelijk is. Bovendien is daar qua natuur veel te beleven.

Wij een ondernemers familie uit de omgeving van Rotterdam en in 2003 is Kick ons team komen versterken.

Als er een kind in je gezin komt wordt alles anders, vooral het op vakantie gaan. Je moet ineens rekening met alles houden, niet te warm, niet te koud, kinderbadje, tussen de middag slapen, kinderbedje, geen stijl in zee lopend strand, geen rotsen, geen hoge golven... en als de kinderen ouder worden; vermaken zij zich wel? Is er genoeg te doen? Zijn er wel vriendjes? Is er wel eten wat ze lusten?

Wij hebben de eerste jaren daar wel mee geworsteld, want je wilt het zelf ook naar je zin hebben op vakantie... je moet immers je het hele jaar al wegcijferen.

Onze vakantie ervaringen:

We zijn naar een resort in Turkije geweest...
Wij vonden het veel te massaal, heel de dag door buffetten en te ver buiten het stadje. Alle resorts staan in de middle of nowhere zodat je alles binnen het complex moet doen. En niet te vergeten het onvermijdelijke animatie-team die iedere avond een toneelstukje opvoert.

We zijn naar het ""kindvriendelijke"" Menorca geweest...
Het begon met een overstap op Ibiza (vliegtuig vol Ibiza-gangers die zich doodergeren aan de kinderen), geen strand (moerassig), onverwarmd zwembad (steenkoud) en saai... Het is niet kindvriendelijk..., er zijn alleen heel veel kinderen!

We zijn naar Tenerife (en alle andere Canarische eilanden) geweest...
Na onze ervaringen in Turkije en Menorca wilden we graag een hotel aan een boulevard zodat we 's avonds nog wat konden lopen en wat drinken...het hotel was schitterend, maar zodra je de boulevard op kwam... wat een armoe! Straten kapot, veel leegstand in de winkelruimtes, overal schreeuwende aanbiedingen voor een pint bier voor € 1,-

We zijn naar Club Med geweest (Tunesie en Turkije)...
Slechte accomodaties, wel goed publiek maar het concept dat het personeel  iedere keer bij je aan tafel komt zitten sprak ons niet zo aan.

Toen dachten we, als we nu eens een eigen huis huren met een zwembad in Spanje..., maar waar? Na wat ge (Hidden by Airbnb) kwamen we uit bij Moraira! Dit sprak ons meteen aan... authentiek, geen hoogbouw, niet te toeristisch, vissersplaatsje, jachthaven, veel winkeltjes, restaurantjes en terrassen, zandstrand, in een baai, strand loopt niet stijl in zee, altijd zon (320 dagen van het jaar), nagenoeg geen regen, goede temperatuur, genoeg vermaak in de buurt voor jong en oud, tennisbanen (ons zoontje tennist veel en graag), kortom dit moest het zijn!

Al deze informatie vonden we op de site van Xenofilia, twee Nederlandse broers die vakantiehuizen verhuren en er zelf ook wonen. Een groot huis, Xenofilia I... 4 kamers, 4 badkamers, verwarmd zwembad en een eigen tennisbaan... Dit is het!

Alle opa's en oma's mee en met z'n zevenen naar Spanje. We hebben een geweldige vakantie gehad, en van het plaatsje Moraira was niets gelogen, helmaal naar ons zin! Alles is er luxe afgewerkt, de straten, het meubilair, schitterende rotondes met kunstwerken. Wij hebben echt wel veel gezien, maar dit was fantastisch! Je zou dan aan st. Tropez prijzen gaan denken...niets is minder waar, een wijntje op het strand kost € 2,- en het eten in de restaurantjes en op de terrassen is zeker niet duurder dan in Nederland.

Inmiddels zijn we zo'n 15 keer terug geweest, nog een paar keer in Xenofilia I zonder opa's en oma's maar met een vriendje voor Kick.

Het enige nadeel van een huis is dat je alles met de auto moet doen... boodschappen, naar het strand en de kinderen zitten een beetje opgesloten in en om het huis. Dus, hebben we de laatste paar keren een appartement in het centrum gehuurd. Zo kon onze zoon, inmiddels 11, gewoon zelf naar het strand en weer terug naar het appartement. Ook hoefden we nu geen vriendje meer mee te nemen, er zijn genoeg kinderen op het strand, en daar is altijd zat te doen... Voetballen, volleyballen, vissen, krabbetjes zoeken, snorkelen, tegen de branding in springen en natuurlijk zwemmen. Wij vinden het lekker om als we van het strand komen op het balkon lekker een wijntje te drinken en wat tappaatjes te eten. Daar vind Kick natuurlijk geen bal aan en hij vindt tappas niet lekker. Hij gaat dan een pizza voor zichzelf halen bij de pizzaria 100 meter verder en gaat lekker even op zijn iPad een spelletje spelen. Iedereen blij! 

Wij zijn ook een keer in januari gegaan, en in de voorjaarsvakantie... hoe zou het dan zijn? Nou, ook gewoon 20 graden en zonnig en totaal niet uitgestorven!

Moeten we dan niet kijken of we hier wat kunnen kopen? Maar we hebben zelf geen tijd om vaak te gaan... kunnen we het dan niet verhuren als we zelf niet gaan?

I am 29 years old, I live in Rotterdam together with my boyfriend and I work for myself as a sustainability consultant and yoga instructor.

I like doing yoga and living in the moment. I love nature and being surrounded by people who enjoy life and simply smile at whatever comes their way.

Wij een ondernemers familie uit de omgeving van Rotterdam en in 2003 is Kick ons team komen versterken.

Als er een kind in je gezin komt wordt alles anders, vooral het op vakantie gaan. Je moet ineens rekening met alles houden, niet te warm, niet te koud, kinderbadje, tussen de middag slapen, kinderbedje, geen stijl in zee lopend strand, geen rotsen, geen hoge golven... en als de kinderen ouder worden; vermaken zij zich wel? Is er genoeg te doen? Zijn er wel vriendjes? Is er wel eten wat ze lusten?

Wij hebben de eerste jaren daar wel mee geworsteld, want je wilt het zelf ook naar je zin hebben op vakantie... je moet immers je het hele jaar al wegcijferen.

Onze vakantie ervaringen:

We zijn naar een resort in Turkije geweest...
Wij vonden het veel te massaal, heel de dag door buffetten en te ver buiten het stadje. Alle resorts staan in de middle of nowhere zodat je alles binnen het complex moet doen. En niet te vergeten het onvermijdelijke animatie-team die iedere avond een toneelstukje opvoert.

We zijn naar het ""kindvriendelijke"" Menorca geweest...
Het begon met een overstap op Ibiza (vliegtuig vol Ibiza-gangers die zich doodergeren aan de kinderen), geen strand (moerassig), onverwarmd zwembad (steenkoud) en saai... Het is niet kindvriendelijk..., er zijn alleen heel veel kinderen!

We zijn naar Tenerife (en alle andere Canarische eilanden) geweest...
Na onze ervaringen in Turkije en Menorca wilden we graag een hotel aan een boulevard zodat we 's avonds nog wat konden lopen en wat drinken...het hotel was schitterend, maar zodra je de boulevard op kwam... wat een armoe! Straten kapot, veel leegstand in de winkelruimtes, overal schreeuwende aanbiedingen voor een pint bier voor € 1,-

We zijn naar Club Med geweest (Tunesie en Turkije)...
Slechte accomodaties, wel goed publiek maar het concept dat het personeel  iedere keer bij je aan tafel komt zitten sprak ons niet zo aan.

Toen dachten we, als we nu eens een eigen huis huren met een zwembad in Spanje..., maar waar? Na wat ge (Hidden by Airbnb) kwamen we uit bij Moraira! Dit sprak ons meteen aan... authentiek, geen hoogbouw, niet te toeristisch, vissersplaatsje, jachthaven, veel winkeltjes, restaurantjes en terrassen, zandstrand, in een baai, strand loopt niet stijl in zee, altijd zon (320 dagen van het jaar), nagenoeg geen regen, goede temperatuur, genoeg vermaak in de buurt voor jong en oud, tennisbanen (ons zoontje tennist veel en graag), kortom dit moest het zijn!

Al deze informatie vonden we op de site van Xenofilia, twee Nederlandse broers die vakantiehuizen verhuren en er zelf ook wonen. Een groot huis, Xenofilia I... 4 kamers, 4 badkamers, verwarmd zwembad en een eigen tennisbaan... Dit is het!

Alle opa's en oma's mee en met z'n zevenen naar Spanje. We hebben een geweldige vakantie gehad, en van het plaatsje Moraira was niets gelogen, helmaal naar ons zin! Alles is er luxe afgewerkt, de straten, het meubilair, schitterende rotondes met kunstwerken. Wij hebben echt wel veel gezien, maar dit was fantastisch! Je zou dan aan st. Tropez prijzen gaan denken...niets is minder waar, een wijntje op het strand kost € 2,- en het eten in de restaurantjes en op de terrassen is zeker niet duurder dan in Nederland.

Inmiddels zijn we zo'n 15 keer terug geweest, nog een paar keer in Xenofilia I zonder opa's en oma's maar met een vriendje voor Kick.

Het enige nadeel van een huis is dat je alles met de auto moet doen... boodschappen, naar het strand en de kinderen zitten een beetje opgesloten in en om het huis. Dus, hebben we de laatste paar keren een appartement in het centrum gehuurd. Zo kon onze zoon, inmiddels 11, gewoon zelf naar het strand en weer terug naar het appartement. Ook hoefden we nu geen vriendje meer mee te nemen, er zijn genoeg kinderen op het strand, en daar is altijd zat te doen... Voetballen, volleyballen, vissen, krabbetjes zoeken, snorkelen, tegen de branding in springen en natuurlijk zwemmen. Wij vinden het lekker om als we van het strand komen op het balkon lekker een wijntje te drinken en wat tappaatjes te eten. Daar vind Kick natuurlijk geen bal aan en hij vindt tappas niet lekker. Hij gaat dan een pizza voor zichzelf halen bij de pizzaria 100 meter verder en gaat lekker even op zijn iPad een spelletje spelen. Iedereen blij! 

Wij zijn ook een keer in januari gegaan, en in de voorjaarsvakantie... hoe zou het dan zijn? Nou, ook gewoon 20 graden en zonnig en totaal niet uitgestorven!

Moeten we dan niet kijken of we hier wat kunnen kopen? Maar we hebben zelf geen tijd om vaak te gaan... kunnen we het dan niet verhuren als we zelf niet gaan?

De rest is geschiedenis... dus kom genieten van dit pareltje aan de Costa Blanca en geniet van ons luxe appartement. 

Welkom!

Welcome at my page!:)
My name is Mirjam, I'm a Dutchie, in daily life I'm a social worker. In my spare time I love to visit new places, nature, singing, a sucker for good coffee,  going out for walks,  try to play guitar ( with the emphasis on 'try'), do my best to give some love to my plants, like to cook and ofcourse... traveling!

Since I was young I already liked traveling.  I remember my family and I were traveling by campervan. Such a joy we had. I continued traveling when I got older. I've been to countries within Europe, but also outside Europe, like: the US, Indonesia, South Africa, Brazil, Curacaõ, Laoh and Thailand.  I've stayed more than a year in Thailand where I've worked on voluntary base as a counselor. 

When I travel I would like to have that feeling of 'home'. That's why I  love to host and to give my guests that feeling of 'home' as well. 

That feeling of traveling and meeting new people, makes me come alive. 
So why not meeting new people, travelers, in my city Rotterdam?

I hope to get to know you a bit as well:)

I am a passionate traveler and Airbnb guest/superhost, having been in the industry for years. I understand the importance of a great experience for both myself and my hosts and strive to make my stays as comfortable, clean, and accurate as possible. Originally from the Netherlands, I have lived in several countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, the United States, and Argentina, and now call Copenhagen, Denmark my home.

I am Joost, I live in Rotterdam and I love to travel and explore the world for work as for pleasure. That's why I can sometimes rent out my cosy apartment in the centre of Rotterdam. Throughout my travelling career I have always used Rotterdam as my base. This is the city where I grew up, studied and most of my family & friends live whom I meet up with for dinner & drinks in the weekend. I hope you will enjoy Rotterdam as much I do. The city has a great vibe with lots of contemporary architectonical buildings and cool bars. In the street of my apartment are many bars and restaurants to be found. I hope you will enjoy yourself.

The neighborhood was born in the 14th century as an independent city, but was later in the 19th century annexed by Rotterdam. Despite the growth of the modern city, Delfshaven has managed to maintain its historical character.<br /><br />An important moment in the history of Delfshaven was the pilgrimage of the Mayflower in 1620.
